MOODLE@BU
=================

This is a modified fork of the popular, open-source Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle. It is mostly intended for use at Binghamton University, but is provided here in the hopes that other educational insitutions may benefit from our modifications. In an ideal world, many of our modifications will eventually end up in Moodle core code. 

Those who are unfamiliar with Moodle are better off checking out the main Moodle repository, at the following URL:
